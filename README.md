# Arshneet-Sim

Heyo. Welcome to the Github Repo for the Arshneet Simulator.

If you're here but not from IELC 2015-2016, you might miss some inside jokes.

Enjoy!

Grinsanity's repository can be found over at [github.com/Grinsanity](https://github.com/Grinsanity), but there isn't really anything there.

If you want to play the game [BETA] you can find it at [this link](http://jsfiddle.net/Grinsanity/6Ltqyt27/1/).

P.S: This is both me and grinsanity's first big projects, so if you find any errors do let us know.
