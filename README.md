# arsh-sim

Heyo. Welcome to the github repo for arshneet sim.

For those of you who aren't the most tech savvy, this is a project hosted on a site called github that allows programmers to keep all of their stuff in one place. (Basically.)

If you're here but not from IELC 2015-2016, you might miss osme inside jokes.

A lot of stuff is hosted on me (Daman) and Ryan's jsfidddler. His can be found at jsfiddle.net/user/355over113 and mine can be found at jsfiddle.net/user/Grinsanity.

Enjoy!

P.S This is hosted on Ryan's github. Mine can be found over at github.com/Grinsanity, but there isn't really anything there.
