# Arshneet Simulator

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Arshneet Simulator. This game was originally created by a peer of ours. [Here's a link to his outdated version](https://4b4030124dae3ec07d9231fd34721a27e4e951d5.googledrive.com/host/0B8EmOAcQMuZbUnNmYTlBby1mOEU/).

## Features

- You get to play as Arshneet (obviously)
- Randomizers deciding if you make it through certain events
- Deaths that make almost no sense at all, and are VERY frequent
- Open-source; contribute to your favourite game or make it your own!
- Day cycle
- Personal attacks toward several real people!
- Unplayable if you tick that option on the dialogue box that says "Disable alerts from this webpage"!

## How to Play

When prompted with a text field, type in one of the options shown in the square brackets to progress. If you type in something other than the given, you'll exit the game and it'll reset (in the future, cookies will be used to save your progress automatically every in-game week).

## Embed

If you want this game on your site, use the following HTML:

	<div id="arshsim"><script src="https://retraction.github.io/arsh-sim/embed.js"></script><noscript><button>Whoops! Your JavaScript's Not On.</button></noscript></div>

The embedded version isn't styled allowing customization of the embedded element.
