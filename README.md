# Arshneet Simulator

Welcome to the GitHub Repo for the Arshneet Simulator. This game was originally created by a peer of ours. [Here's a link to his version.](https://4b4030124dae3ec07d9231fd34721a27e4e951d5.googledrive.com/host/0B8EmOAcQMuZbUnNmYTlBby1mOEU/)

If you're here but not from IELC 2015-2016, you might miss some inside jokes.

Enjoy!

Grinsanity's repository can be found over at [github.com/Grinsanity](https://github.com/Grinsanity), but there isn't really anything there.

If you want to play the game [BETA] you can find it at http://355over113.github.io/arsh-sim/.

P.S. This is both me and Grinsanity's first large projects, so if we're doing something wrong, feel free to help us out.
