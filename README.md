# Arshneet Simulator

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Arshneet Simulator. This game was originally created by a peer of ours. [Here's a link to his version.](https://4b4030124dae3ec07d9231fd34721a27e4e951d5.googledrive.com/host/0B8EmOAcQMuZbUnNmYTlBby1mOEU/)

## Features

- You get to play as Arshneet (obviously)
- Randomizers deciding if you make it through certain events
- Deaths that make almost no sense at all
- Personal attacks toward several characters based off of real people!

## Embed

If you want this game on your site, use this embed code:

`<div id="arshsim"><script src="https://355over113.github.io/arsh-sim/embed"></script><noscript><button>Whoops! Your JavaScript's Not On.</button></noscript></div>`

The embedded version isn't styled allowing customization of the embedded element.

If you're here but not from IELC 2015-2016, you might miss some inside jokes.

P.S. This is both mine and Grinsanity's first large project, so if we're doing something wrong, feel free to help us out.
