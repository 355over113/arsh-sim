Welcome to the Github Repo for the Arshneet Simulator.\r\n\r\nIf you're here but not from IELC 2015-2016, you might miss some inside jokes.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nGrinsanity's repository can be found over at [github.com/Grinsanity](https://github.com/Grinsanity), but there isn't really anything there.\r\n\r\nIf you want to play the game [BETA] you can find it at [http://jsfiddle.net/Grinsanity/6Ltqyt27/1/](http://jsfiddle.net/Grinsanity/6Ltqyt27/1/).\r\n\r\nP.S.
